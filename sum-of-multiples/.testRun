  Sum Of Multiples
    √ no multiples within limit (4 ms)
    √ one factor has multiples within limit (1 ms)
    √ more than one multiple within limit
    √ more than one factor with multiples within limit
    √ each multiple is only counted once
    √ a much larger limit
    √ three factors
    √ factors not relatively prime
    √ some pairs of factors relatively prime and some not
    √ one factor is a multiple of another
    √ much larger factors (2 ms)
    √ all numbers are multiples of 1 (1 ms)
    √ no factors means an empty sum (1 ms)
    √ the only multiple of 0 is 0
    √ the factor 0 does not affect the sum of multiples of other factors
    √ solutions using include-exclude must extend to cardinality greater than 3 (3 ms)
