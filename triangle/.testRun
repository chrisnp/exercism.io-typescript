  Triangle
    √ equilateral triangles have equal sides (5ms)
    √ larger equilateral triangles also have equal sides
    √ isosceles triangles have last two sides equal
    √ isosceles trianges have first and last sides equal
    √ isosceles triangles have two first sides equal
    √ isosceles triangles have in fact exactly two sides equal (1ms)
    √ scalene triangles have no equal sides
    √ scalene triangles have no equal sides at a larger scale too
    √ scalene triangles have no equal sides in descending order either
    √ very small triangles are legal (1ms)
    √ test triangles with no size are illegal
    √ triangles with negative sides are illegal (1ms)
    √ triangles violating triangle inequality are illegal
